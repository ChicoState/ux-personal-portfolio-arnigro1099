# UX Portfolio

Hello everyone! My name is Alex Nigro and I am a senior majoring in CINS. A couple things about me are I like to play video games and tennis. I have been playing tennis for about half my life and made varsity as a sophomore on my high school tennis team. My favorite place my family and I like vacation to is Morro Bay, which is a nice and quiet fishing town on the central coast near San Luis Obispo. I am pretty much an open book when it comes to discussions of any kind despite my quiet and reserved appearance so do not be afraid to reach out!
