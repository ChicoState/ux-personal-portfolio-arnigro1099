# Solving the Shower Handle Mystery
### By Alex Nigro - March 10th, 2024
Now you might be thinking, shower handles? Really? They are not that difficult to figure out and we use them all the time. Well, while we may encounter them quite often, there are a plethora of variations of shower handles that all usually follow standard industry **conventions**. Some of these conventions include being able to turn the handle to adjust the heat of the water, turning the handle to a certain angle to either turn on or turn off the water flow, turning the handle to adjust the pressure of the water flow, and lableing which side of the mechanism is for hot and cold water. 

## Variations and Proof of Conventions
Below are some examples of different variations of shower handles:

As you can see, all these designs are pretty similar to one another and include all the same features as listed above. The main difference is the shape of the handle the user interacts with. Fortunately, despite the shape being different, the designers of the "lever" and "knob" variants included arrows to explicitly notify the user which directions to turn the handle to get either hot or cold water. On the other hand, the "cross" variant lacks such direction aside from a red and blue dot on either side of the handle. It is much more vague and forces the user to guess on how the handle should even rotate. Similar to this, the shower head I have had an interesting experience with is this one here:

## Personal Experience
Like the other shower handle variants, it too follows some industry standards with having a circle that is half red and half blue on the underside of the handle and labeling an "H" to show where the hot water angle lies. Now when I first encountered this handle, my immediate instinct was to turn it to the left to see if it produced cold water. However, to my surprise, it did not budge. That's strange, the blue part of the circle is on the left side so wouldn't it make sense for the handle to turn to the left? Since that did not work, I turned it the only other way I could which was to the right. If we view the entire shower handle as a clock, the off position is at 6 o'clock and the "H" is at 12 o'clock. I turned it all the way to 12 where the "H" was to see how quickly the water would heat up. Once again to my surprise, the water remained cold and the pressure appeared to lessen as well. I then angled the handle to be at 3 so it was halfway between the top and the off position. The result of this, the water began to get warmer. This was very puzzling to me so I proceeded to turn the handle to about 5 o'clock. The water reached the hottest temperature and highest pressure I have felt up to this point. This shower handle was unlike any other I have encountered in my entire life.

## Final Thoughts and Suggestions for Improvement
My experience with this shower handle proved that my **mental model** of how I expected it to work did not align with the **conceptual model** of how it actually worked. To go over briefly, a <ins>mental model</ins> is what the user believes about a system or application. It helps them predict how the system will work and influences how they will interact with it. On the other hand, a <ins>conceptual model</ins> is like a map that shows how a system works. It includes its structure, what it does, and how people can use it. These two models need to align because if they do not, then you run into an issue like I had where I was very confused as to why the opposite temperatue change was happening when I turned the shower handle. Now this may have been in part due to ineffective mapping techniques used by the designers. The half red and blue circle and "H" were misleading since they did not accurately indicate which direction I needed to turn the handle to correctly change the water temperature and pressure. Also, the directions I could even turn the handle in general were not clearly or accurately displayed. 

There are a couple suggestions I could make that would improve this design. Firstly, remove the half red and blue circle on the underside of the handle and place 2 solid dots, one red and one blue on the circular base to show where the cold and hot water thresholds are. If I never bothered to look under the handle, I would have never known it was there in the first place. Lastly, add arrows either on the circular base or on the handle itself to show which direction(s) it can be turned. There is a possibility that another user in the future could mistake the handle not moving to the left as it just being stuck and accidentally break it by attempting to force it to the left. This would be a dreadful outcome indeed. Simple changes like these could definitely assist with **error prevention**, which is the process of alerting a user when they're making an error, with the intention to make it easy for them to do whatever it is they are doing without making a mistake. If better error prevention were to be implemented, it would help mitigate future frustration and potential damage users could inflict on the system due to confusion or misunderstandings.
